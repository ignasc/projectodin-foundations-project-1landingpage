### Main challenges

* The biggest challenge was to fit images to the small cards neatly, keep their sizes fixed and maintain ratio.

* Overall layout in terms of what should be wrapped in div elements to achieve desired layout.

* Keeping css file tidy.

### Final thoughts

My past experience with flexbox was not a very pleasant one, mainly due to not learning it in a structured way. Now that I grasped the concept content and items within flexbox, it feels much more intuitive. And I also like that I can skip doing a mobile version, at least for simple page layouts.
